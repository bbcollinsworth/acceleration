Acceleration: The Definitive, Unofficial Guide
---------
by Dan Levitan

 
Hardcore gamers will remember this classic web-only keyboard game, an instant, if short-lived cult hit popular for several hours in February of 2015.  The game is simple, but somewhat addictive.  The goal: guide your compulsively accelerating and infinitely fueled ship to a series of planets, and bump into them.  After which, you will not explode but be rewarded with a point, and bounce inexplicably in a random direction to make your way to the next planet, and so on.
 
There are three keys to the game, and once you master them, you will eventually click to another tab in boredom (Special note: when you return to the Acceleration tab many hours later, the game will pick up right where it left off, but you will no longer be able to control your ship, due to the low mental acuity of the game designers, and you will drift off into space until you click back to YouTube):
 
1.       THE SUN IS YOUR GOD

 
The most important rule of  Acceleration is to stay near or inside the inner solar system at all costs. Once you are flung out to the nether regions of cold, dark space, the hyper-realistic gravity effects will make it nearly impossible to return, leaving a player oscillating wildly back and forth across the universe, passing through the solar system only to whiz by your precious target planet at terrifying speed.
 
Many players mistakenly believe the Sun cannot be touched or would somehow ‘hurt’ – but in fact the opposite is true, the sun is your friend, and for whatever reason, there is no way to get hurt in Acceleration. It is even possible to get stuck “on” the sun, due to its intense gravity, but once freed this is actually a blessing, as your speed will be greatly diminished.  Love the sun, and let it shine upon you.
 
2.       SNEAK UP FROM BEHIND

 
It is much easier to make contact with your target planet if you approach it from behind – try to catch up with where the planet will be when you get there.  Once you have accelerated significantly, it is nearly impossible to crash into the intended planet head-on through the “noob” game-of-chicken strategy. Approaching gently from behind will also lead to softer bounce-off.
 
3.       JUST WAIT

 
Much like the long-run heat death of the actual universe, the world of Acceleration simplifies in the long-run.  Over time, the planets begin to clump together, like sad children.  It is not uncommon to bounce off one target planet directly into the next one – double points!  Some veteran players even say that the planets themselves begin to slow down eventually, though these legends are unproven.
 
So that’s it. Is the game great?  Well, no.  Does it ever end?  No.  But conquer it using the strategies above, and you can become a LEGEND.
